# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering

In this project, I used K-means Clustering to conduct customer segmentation from a mall customer data base. 
The work required normalization since K-means Clustering is a distance-based model and the ranges of the variables are different from each other. 
After implementing the trained model, I categorized the customers into 5 groups. I also built a GUI for an user-friendly experience.

**For more details, please look into the file since I explained very carefully in it.**
